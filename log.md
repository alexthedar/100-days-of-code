# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 17, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished learning Sass.  Moving onto Bourbon/Bitters/Nea t

**Thoughts:** Sass + Bourbon = power.  I glanced at Susy and it looks good too but Bourbon seems more robust right now.  

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 2: Jan 18, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished learning Bourbon, Neat, Bitters.

**Thoughts**: Bourbon, Neat and Bitters combined make for a powerful CSS framework that can greatly ease site creation.  Need to update personal site to incorporate these lessons but not ready yet.  Still gestating.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A


### Day 3: Jan 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began rebuilding personal site

**Thoughts** Undecided if I want to use Bourbon ,neat and bitters or just susy and build rest myself.  Redefining all the colors in bourbon for material might end up being tedious.  For now ready with bourbon.  Gonna check out susy now.

### Day 11: Jan 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Shift gears to do Code Challenge

**Thoughts** I was given a lot of time to do this code challenge so I am exploring if I can learn Vue as I do the code challenge.

### Day 12 - 24: Feb 1 - 13, 2017

**Progress**: Finished two code challenges.  One was a layout and the other make a photo viewing app.

**Thoughts** Learned and used VueJS to create both apps.  I like it a lot.  Mush easier than using React or Angular IMO.  I also like how the html, js and css are always in the same file.  Makes it easy to debug.
Need to do more Sass and get more used to it.  Vue with sass would be powerful i think but had trouble getting webpack to decode the sass.
