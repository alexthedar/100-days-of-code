# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 17, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished learning Sass.  Moving onto Bourbon/Bitters/Nea t

**Thoughts:** Sass + Bourbon = power.  I glanced at Susy and it looks good too but Bourbon seems more robust right now.  

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 2: Jan 18, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished learning Bourbon, Neat, Bitters.

**Thoughts**: Bourbon, Neat and Bitters combined make for a powerful CSS framework that can greatly ease site creation.  Need to update personal site to incorporate these lessons but not ready yet.  Still gestating.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A


### Day 3: Jan 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began rebuilding personal site

**Thoughts** Undecided if I want to use Bourbon ,neat and bitters or just susy and build rest myself.  Redefining all the colors in bourbon for material might end up being tedious.  For now ready with bourbon.  Gonna check out susy now.
